# Jekyll workflow and deployment

Although the documentation is written in asciidoc, it can also be
deployed as a website using the the Jekyll static site generator.
The Jekyll version creates one page for each group of related subjects,
over 100 pages in total.

Operation of Jekyll has been wrapped in a Makefile for convenience:

- `make build` will build the site and all assets into the `_site`
  directory for hosting

- `make preview` will build the site and run a preview on a lightweight
  HTTP server on the port printed on the command line

- `make all` will build the site and run a number of tests.  It is
  recommended to do this before publishing

- `make clean` will clean up files generated by the build process

Jekyll and the build process both use asciidoctor, so you need all the
same depedencies for adoc building plus the Jekyll depedencies and GNU
make.  To simplify replication of this process a `Containerfile` is
provided in the repository.  It should be compatible with the `docker`
command although it was developed with the entirely free software
`podman` command.  An example use:

```
REPO=~/repos/onboarding-to-bitcoin-core/
podman build -v $REPO:/srv/ -t guide $REPO
id=$( podman run --cap-add NET_ADMIN --cap-add NET_RAW --detach -v $REPO:/srv/ -p 0.0.0.0:8080:4000 -it localhost/guide:latest )
podman attach $id
```
