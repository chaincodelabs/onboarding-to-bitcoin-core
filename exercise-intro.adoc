****
Using either `bitcoin-cli` in your terminal, or a <<{contributor-exercises}test_shell_nodes,Jupyter Notebook>> in conjunction with the `TestShell` class from the Bitcoin Core Test Framework, try to complete the following exercises.

Changes to the codebase will require you to re-compile afterwards.

Don't forget to use the compiled binaries found in your source directory, for example `/home/user/bitcoin/src/bitcoind`, otherwise your system might select a previously-installed (non-modified) version of bitcoind.
