= Onboarding to Bitcoin Core

This documentation is currently hosted at https://bitcoincore.academy[bitcoincore.academy] however this location may be subject to change in the future.

== Development

=== Local Development with Docker

The easiest way to serve the site locally is using Docker:

[source,bash]
----
docker compose up dev
----

This will:
- Build the development environment
- Install all dependencies (Ruby gems and Node.js packages)
- Start a Jekyll development server on port 4000
- Mount the current directory for live reloading
- Use development environment settings

The site will be available at http://localhost:4000

=== Makefile Commands

The project includes several useful Makefile targets for development and deployment:

==== Docker Commands
- `make docker-dev` - Start development server using Docker Compose
- `make docker-shell` - Open an interactive shell in the Docker container
- `make docker-clean` - Clean up Docker containers and system resources

==== Build Commands
- `make build` - Build the Jekyll site into `_site` directory
- `make preview` - Build and serve the site locally with live reload
- `make clean` - Clean up generated files

==== Testing and Quality
- `make test-before-build` - Run pre-build tests (Markdown linting)
- `make test-after-build` - Run post-build tests (link checking, duplicate anchors)
- `make all` - Complete build and test pipeline

==== Output Formats
- `make html` - Generate single-page HTML version
- `make pdf` - Generate PDF version
- `make epub` - Generate EPUB version
- `make publish` - Full publish pipeline with all formats
- `make production` - Production build with all tests

=== Development Workflow

1. Local Development: Use `docker compose up dev` or `make docker-dev` to start the development server
2. Shell Access: Use `make docker-shell` to access the container for debugging or manual commands
3. Testing: Run `make all` before submitting changes to ensure everything builds and passes tests
4. Cleanup: Use `make docker-clean` to clean up containers and free disk space

=== Dependencies

The project uses:
- Jekyll for static site generation
- Asciidoctor for processing AsciiDoc files
- Mermaid CLI for diagram generation
- HTMLProofer for link checking
- Markdownlint for Markdown validation

All dependencies are managed through the Docker container, so you don't need to install anything locally except Docker.
